                <h1>Hi, I'm <span class="highlight">Mr Shyam Kumar</span></h1>
                <p class="hero-subtitle"> I am a B.Tech 3rd-year Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) student with a deep passion for software development. I love solving complex problems and building efficient systems that have a real-world impact. My journey in development has been driven by continuous learning, hands-on experience, and a strong foundation in Java, SQL, and backend technologies.
            
                    During my internship at Tata Steel, I worked on a Manufacturing Execution System (MES) implementation project, where I integrated the QADT system with MES to automate quality result postings to SAP. I designed the UI, developed both auto and manual posting options, and worked extensively with Microsoft Excel, SQL Server, and Visual Studio 2022.
                    
                    Beyond my internship experience, I have solved 100+ DSA problems, earning a 5-star rating in Java on HackerRank, and completed the Node.js Developer Path certification from MongoDB University. I am currently preparing for internship opportunities with a stipend to apply my skills to impactful projects and grow as a software developer.
